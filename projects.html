      This project is a basketball simulator. You can pick any player that is a
      starter in the NBA. You have a choice where you can either shoot a 3
      pointer, layup, mid-range, or a dunk. Your chances of making these depends
      on how good the player that you chose is. You are playing against a random
      opponent and you are trying to beat them to 30 points. Your goal is to get
      to the NBA Finals which happens after 5 games.

      My second project is a CRUD app. With this Crud app you can create a
      roster for any sports team. You can view each player in your update a
      player, delete a player, create a new player, and view an individual
      player.
