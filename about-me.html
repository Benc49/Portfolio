        My name is Ben Crosby and I was born in Nasheville, Tennessee but I have
        spent most of my life in Oxford, Mississippi. I graduated high school
        from Oxford High School. I got into coding around my junior year when I
        heard about base camp. Before then I never thought I would get into
        coding but I am an open minded person who is willing to try anything. I
        realized that I actually enjoy coding and want to pursue a career in it
        so I thought that Base Camp would be a great opportunity for me.
